# Lights Out Game with React

Lights Out is a classic puzzle game made with React that challenges players to turn off all the lights on a game board.

 The game consists of a grid of lights that are either on or off, and the player's objective is to turn off all the lights by toggling them on or off.

When a light is toggled, it will also toggle the adjacent lights horizontally and vertically.

The game is won when all the lights on the board are turned off, and the game is lost when the player reaches a state where they cannot turn off any more lights.

As a React application, it provides a smooth and interactive user experience.
